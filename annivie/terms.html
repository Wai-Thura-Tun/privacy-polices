  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 25, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to Annivie! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Annivie app ("App"). By using Annivie, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>Annivie lets you track and celebrate anniversaries with photos and notifications. To use the App, you must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Be at least 13 years old.</li>
    <li>Not use the App for illegal purposes (e.g., uploading harmful content).</li>
    <li>Provide accurate information if signing in with Google or Apple.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Account Responsibility</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keeping your account credentials secure.</li>
    <li>All content you add (e.g., photos, anniversary notes), ensuring it complies with laws.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>We own Annivie, including its code, design, and features. You retain ownership of your content (e.g., photos, notes). By uploading content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to store, sync, and display it within the App for its functionality (e.g., via Firebase Firestore).</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Annivie uses third-party services like Firebase (Google) for storage and notifications and AdMob (Google) for ads. Your use of these services is subject to their terms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Google Terms</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/">Apple Terms</a> (for Sign-In)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms, misuse the App, or for any reason at our discretion.</p>

  <h2>6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>Annivie is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We’re not liable for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data loss, service interruptions, or third-party actions (e.g., Firebase/AdMob outages).</li>
    <li>Indirect, incidental, or consequential damages from using the App.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

  <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Thailand, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms—changes will be posted here with a new “Last Updated” date. Significant updates may be announced in the App. Continued use after changes means you accept them.</p>
